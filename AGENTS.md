# Agent instructions

This repo is a mob plugin (on-device OCR / text recognition; face/pose
planned). Conventions are mob's — read `~/code/mob/AGENTS.md` +
`~/code/mob/CLAUDE.md` first, and `~/code/mob/MOB_PLUGINS.md` for the
manifest schema.

Pre-commit checklist (same as mob):

```bash
mix test
mix format
mix credo --strict       # includes ExSlop + jump_credo_checks
```

Native changes (.m / .zig / .kt) aren't exercised by `mix test` — they
need a `mix mob.deploy --native` of a host app (mob_plugin_demo) and a
device check before committing.

The pre-push hook (`.githooks/pre-push`, activated via
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) runs format/credo/compile on every
push and the full suite when mix.exs changes (release preflight).

Releases: mix.exs version bump on master triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`
(tag + GitHub Release + Hex publish). See ~/code/mob/RELEASE.md for the
trigger model; do NOT bump versions without explicit permission.
